# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: (Even though Austin went through this in class I just wanted to complete it) Conditional statements are used to make decisions in your code and then make something happen based on the result. They use booleans to determine their decision. You can use if statements and the ternary operator to achieve these!

  Researched answer: Conditionals can determine the end or beginning of a certain process. Also just found out you can also use !== for strict inequality along with nesting conditionals.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is the software on your local machine that allows you to interact(e.g. push/pull) with Github which is the remote. We use git and Github on a daily basis to update the code base.

  Researched answer: git is a version control tool used to log your changes on files and applications and push them to the remote repository on Github



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Logical and relational operators return boolean values along with the equality operators. Super useful for useful functions that ask questions to both the user and the machine.

  Researched answer: Undefined is the result if your value isn't returned and null as intentional absence of a value(considered falsy)


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: an index is the position of a element within another data type. Think like a number within an array, the index also starts at 0. A value could be a number, boolean, or other primitive data types. The difference between them is each value has an assigned index based on its position in the code.

  Researched answer: An index can be viewed as a list assigning itself to individual data types. Values tell you the data type that is contained in an index



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the action of continuous repetition of a certain thing for a specified number of times. It can go infinitely if you don't tell it to stop at some point so beware!

  Researched answer: Iteration can be achieved through loops and you can assign them to loop through indexes. You can also use them to loop functions or loops code within a function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Driver and Navigator, that's all. Juuust kidding the driver is the person who will be coding and listening to the navigator who will be directing the driver like your passenger with google maps. Bouncing ideas constantly off eachother is important, as they're another resource with knowledge on the topic at hand. Switching between being the driver and the navigator at certain points is a good idea to keep productive and engaged. Talking out your ideas as the navigator before directing your driver is a good idea.

  Researched answer: Some other techniques on pair programming involve making sure you can accurately hear each other and understand what is being implied. Do NOT go at it alone. You don't want to be the driver with nobody talking to you or the navigator with a driver who does all the work while not even acknowledging you. Don't judge someone based on skill level, if they need help then help them understand and be nice about it. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that takes in other functions as parameters or values. There's also built in methods that innately are higher order functions when you apply them.

2. Jest: A framework for javascript! specifically a testing framework that helps make sure your code has unique global states so there's no conflicts in your code. I assume we'll be using it with react once we get there!

3. Objects: I like objects in js because they're literally objects. Kind of like bigger variables. You create an object and assign properties to them to make the object whatever you want. They also have methods that allow you to do certain things with your object at specified times. This might be a challenge

4. Method: There's multiple types of methods. Generator methods, Async methods, and Async generator methods. methods are used within objects as initializers 

5. Classes: Classes are not objects, but the template for objects. They always have constructor() within them so they can create objects.
